# The example REALLY matters.  Experiment with:
 - patient, jane  |  stooge, larry
 - animal, cat, kitten, mittens  |  transport, airplane, B747
 - path, file

# references
# Not so obvious to screw up specifically because languages separate 'class'
# from 'object'.  You can't *easily* create a new object, you have to call a
# constructor function to get a new one.  So "assignment means share reference"
# has the right feel.

patient = { name:str; age:int }

jane = patient
jane.name = 'jane'
print patient.name

# values
