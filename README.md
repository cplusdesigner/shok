The lush command shell is a non-POSIX interactive command language interpreter with an expressive scripting language.  It is a modern, discoverable environment intended for every-day command invocation, process management, and filesystem manipulation.

======

lush is in its early stages of initial development.  It has the framework for a shell, a lexer, a parser, and an "evaluator" (type-checking, AST execution, program invocation).  It does not yet let you run commands nor write programs.  Most core features have yet to be implemented.  All language attributes are suitable for discussion and replacement.  Nevertheless, it is progressing quickly and steadily.
