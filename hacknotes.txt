Program and ProgramArgs are pretty sad
 - we shouldn't need to tokenize then un-tokenize the user's commandlines; dangerous that we could screw it up
  -- well, it's not /that/ bad...
 - intermingling expblocks amongst program/programargs -- where should this be allowed?

        {ls}-al

        {ls} -al {y}

        {python}2.7 {foo}.py

 - so basically, anywhere.........
