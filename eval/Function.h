/* Function
 *
 * All methods are Functions, and all Functions are methods.  woosh.
 * Also, Functions are Objects.
 *
 * A function may have multiple signatures.  Two signatures on the same
 * function, for now, must have different # arguments.  This will eventually be
 * relaxed to: lining up the arguments, no OR-item from one can be identical to
 * an OR-item of the other.   e.g. @(A|B)&X  <=>  @(C|A)&X  (not allowed)
 * Different overloads may have the same or different return types.
 *
 * The function does not take ownership of any Type* or Object* it is given as
 * part of an Arg.  These must and will outlive the Function.
 *
 * Note that a function that "returns void" does not leave its returntype NULL,
 * it actually should have a void object that presently does not exist...
