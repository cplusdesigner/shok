/* Scope
 *
 * A Scope holds a local namespace of instantiated objects.  Block and RootNode
 * both have a Scope.  The depth tells you its nesting level: depth 0 is the
 * global scope (held by RootNode).  A scope depth of 1 is fake, for silly
 * implementation reasons relating to how a '{' flips you from command-mode
 * into the global scope.  Thus scope depth 1 just defers down to the global
 * scope, and depth 2 really represents the first nested scope level.
 *
 * A Scope is backed by an ObjectStore, and merely implements the parent-scope
 * and scope-depth logic on top of it.  An ObjectStore only knows what's in its
 * store; a Scope knows that if an object can't be found in its store then it
 * should defer up a parentScope chain until it finds it or doesn't.
 *
 * newObject() creates a new Object in the scope, but it is marked as "pending"
 * until it is finally either commit() or revert().  This allows any
 * setup/analysis stages to track the Object and its Type but lets us abort in
 * case of error.  All of this is handled by the underlying ObjectStore.
