/* Lush abstract syntax tree evaluator
 *
 * Reads lines of specially-formatted AST text input from stdin, performs
 * static analysis to ensure it specifies a valid program, and executes the
 * program.  This may involve forking off child processes to run shell
 * commands.
 *
 * In the future, this may be broken into several parts; such as operator
 * re-ordering, type-checking and static analysis, optimization, code/bytecode
 * generation, and execution.
 *
 * Note that in the multiple stages of the evaluator, we perform each step
 * through to completion before advancing to the next phase.  I'd like to undo
 * this.  Certainly evaluation (i.e. execution) should not happen until all
 * possible validation / analysis of all possible nodes has happened.  But for
 * the other stages, I think it might be best to provide as deep error-checking
 * as possible on a line of code before reporting any errors regarding nodes
 * that follow it.  Unsure about that though.  For now we perform each full
 * stage of analysis (completion, reordering operators, static analysis,
 * evaluation) in sequence.
