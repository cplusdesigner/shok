/* Expression
 *
 * This just wraps an expression, which could be an atom (literal, variable
 * name, etc.) or the top operator of an expression tree.
 *
 * At setup() we reorder the operators (since they will be initially given to
 * the AST in a ridiculous ordering from the parser), then validate them
 * bottom-up.
 *
 * This single expression may be owned by a command block, in which case the
 * expression is meant to evaluate to an object on which we'll call
 * ->str.escape() and then provide this text as a command-line fragment.
 *
 * The expression's Type is determined at setup() time.
