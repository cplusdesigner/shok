/* Expression
 *
 * This wraps an expression.  Each child could be an atom (literal, variable
 * name, etc.) or the top operator of an expression tree.
 *
 * The operators are given to us by the AST (parser) in a ridiculous and
 * flattened ordering, so at setup() time we must arrange our children into a
 * tree and then reorder them for operator precedence.  Then we validate the
 * operators bottom-up.
 *
 * This single expression may be owned by an expression block, in which case
 * the expression is meant to evaluate to an object on which we'll call
 * ->str.escape() and then provide this text as a command-line fragment.
 *
 * The expression's Type is determined at setup() time.
