Hacking radar, in no particular order:
1. Parser rewrite implies we need to double-check all language features,
especially any statements, that their ASTs are being constructed appropriately.

2. Create some test built-in functions


Known bugs, in no particular priority:
0. Rename project

1. Operators are evaluated in the wrong order.  Gasp!
 - Associativity needs to be defined
 - Remove operator tree construction from Expression, into Operator
 - Merge operator tree construction and operator reordering into one function
   that does its job properly, using both precedence and associativity
    -- shunting-yard or some such

2. eval: Node children could be held by an auto_ptr list of sorts, rather than
bare pointers.

3. Comments -- not lexed

4. Quoted literals e.g. strings -- not lexed

5. Error signalling/synchronization between parser and evaluator

Shell:
- signals
- comments
- string literals
- int literals

Command-line:
- ^L: clear screen
- left/right/home/end : navigate a line
- up/down: basic command history
- basic filesystem tab completion
- terminal colours :)
- nicer prompt

Program invocation:

Programming language:
- #!VERSION pragma
- a couple built-in types
- basic expressions
- implement ->str on object

Eventually:
- Unicode support
- I/O redirection
- command pipes
- jobs
- security review
