0.5 Allow semicolon described in notes.txt (parser)

1. Command invocation vs. code/exp blocks (parser/evaluator)

2. Run commands synchronously with redirected I/O

3. Pragmas e.g. #!VERSION

4. Implement objects

5. Implement literals (and a few hardcoded objects that support them)

6. Basic expressions should work

7. New statements

Eventually:
- Unicode support
